# Hearten Horticulture Booking System

A local gardening business called Hearten Horticulture requires a booking a system

The project should be able to function as a portal for customers to book sessions without coming into conflict with other customer's booking sessions. The system should be able to tell customers when the company is free to work on their garden while keeping their user data anonymous for others to see.


## UX
A local business requires an app for their customers to book gardening sessions.

### Colour Scheme

The site features the following colours:

Forest Green Traditional: #134611;
India Green: #3E8914;
Green Pigment: #3DA35D;
Light Green: #96E072;
Nyanza: #E8FCCF;
The colours were selected for their often associated use within the gardening industry with the exception of Nyanza, an off-green/yellow which will be used for contrast.

### Typography

- [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

Most of the website will use some variation of barlow condensed styled in various ways, such as italic and bold. They will be weighted between 300 and 500. The fallback font will be sans-serif.

## User Stories

### Site owner goals
- Give customers a portal in which to book sessions for garden maintence
- Give the company a way to plan availablity for other projects that aren't garden maintenance.

### Customer Goals
As a user:
- Immeditately know who this site is for
- Simple navigation and with booking feedback.
- View the site on mobile so I can book in customer sessions myself in person for elderly customers with no IT experience.

As a logged in customer :
- I need to be able to book sessions, even block book for a few hours.
- I want to be able to see sessions I have booked in the past and whether they happen or not due to the weather.

As a admin for the business, I want to :
- I want to see which sessions users are booking in.
- Let customers know when I'm not available.
- Edit and delete sessions.
- Edit/delete customers we no longer work with.
- See all sessions booked.

## Wireframes
To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
